# Introduction
Do you have your favourite SMU room that you always study or do project meetings in? Isn't it frustrating when your favourite room is booked because you were not fast enough ðŸ˜­?

This tool serves to automate the booking process entirely with your configuration specified in a `.env` file ðŸš€!

# Tech Stack
This tool is built entirely with the following Tech Stack:

- Cron jobs

# Installation
1. Ensure you have NodeJS installed [link to installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone the repo to local
3. cd to root directory
4. run `npm install`

# Usage
To run the script, just run at the root directory

```bash
node --env-file=.env main.js
```

# How does it work?
1. The tool launches a profileless browser and logs you in via SMU login page
    - The FBS site would either redirect you to log in directly via SMU login page, or redirect you to an intermediate page asking you to open your Microsoft Authenticator app and enter the code displayed on the web page in the app itself.
    - If you are redirected to the latter, this tool will automatically select the option to log you in via SMU login page.
    - Support for Microsoft's Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is not supported yet, but if there is demand for it, I can implement it using the npm package `otpauth` and with some simple Microsoft Authenticator setup.
2. After login, the tool saves your login state in a local file stored in the directory `./playwright/.auth/user.json`.
    - This file is git ignored to protect my own user data.
3. The tool will then launch a new browser to start the auto booking process.
    - Note that if you have logged in before and you have the local login state file, and that login has not expired, Steps 1 and 2 will be automatically skipped.
4. That's it!

**Note:** Logging can be found in the directory `./logs/logging.log` and `./logs/cron.log` (if you have set up a cron job, explained below)

# Disclaimer

## Disclaimer 1
Please be considerate to other SMU students!!! Please only book the room if you intend to actually use it!

## Disclaimer 2
This tool is best used when you want to book a room at exactly the date (14 days from today) when it releases. This is because the tool will fail if the room you are trying to book is not available. At 0000hrs 14 days from today, you can almost guarantee that the room is available.
